# BiCrystal
``BiCrystal`` is a Python program that builds commensurate and incommensurate crystal structures of layered materials. The current version reads CIF files and writes the new structure to a QUANTUM ESPRESSO input file. The program also provides additional information such as the bond distance between atoms, lattice vectors in Bohr and Angstrom, and a simple 3D plot of each layer.

# Overview
Building unit cells of arbitrary size is often an inevitable task when studying the physical and mechanical properties of layered materials such as graphene, hexagonal Boron Nitride, transition metal dichalcogenides. Although most visualzation software such as Xcrysden, VESTA or Avogadro provide very powerful tools for analysing and manipulating periodic crystal structures, constructing large unit cells in bilayers with one of the layers perturbed can be very daunting. ``BiCrystal`` provides a convinient and easy way of creating new crystal structures of arbitrary size from CIF files.
