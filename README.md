# BiCrystal
``BiCrystal`` is a Python program that builds commensurate and incommensurate crystal structures of layered materials. The current version reads CIF files and writes the new structure to a QUANTUM ESPRESSO input file. The program also provides additional information such as the bond distance between atoms, lattice vectors in Bohr and Angstrom, and a simple 3D plot of each layer.
